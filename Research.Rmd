I'm passionate about improving suicide risk assessment and intervention. I research individual characteristics that may affect one's vulnerability or resilience in the face of negative life events and stressors.  In particular, I am interested in understanding how *perfectionism* may affect responses to certain negative life events, and how this might contribute to poorer mental health outcomes —-- up to and including suicide risk. Relatedly, I evaluate how we can best train mental health professionals to help clients at risk of suicide cope with negative life events.
