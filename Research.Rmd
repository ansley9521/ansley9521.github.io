I am passionate about improving suicide risk assessment and intervention. I research individual characteristics that may affect one's vulnerability or resilience in the face of negative life events.  In particular, I am interested in understanding how *perfectionism* may affect responses to certain negative life events, and how this might contribute to poorer mental health outcomes —-- up to and including suicide risk. Relatedly, I evaluate how we can best train mental health professionals to help suicidal clients cope with negative life events. As part of this research, I have assisted in writing and preparing grants submitted to SAMHSA and NIMH, and have conducted data analyses and write-ups for quarterly, annual, and final grant reports.
